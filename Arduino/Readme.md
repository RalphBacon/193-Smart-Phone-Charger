# Arduino Sketch

### To Do
+ Complete the coding to accomodate the SSD1306 - ie, issue messages to the screen at appropriate times
+ Implement the buzzer (requires PWM signal)
+ Implement the LED on D8
+ Fix the rolling average current display to fill (or clear) the array upon first connection (disconnection)

The current sketch works, but requires refactoring to accommodate the SSD1306 screen.
